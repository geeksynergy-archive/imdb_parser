This as opposed to the spectacular, entertaining, sensational, dramatic activities which dominate much of the contemporary film-making. Now, all this has to do with my understanding and belief of what acts really affect the positive changes in man, society, humanity. I am interested in recording the subtle, almost invisible acts, experiences, feelings, as opposed to the tough, harsh, violent activities and political actions, and especially, political systems of our time.""",As I Was Moving Ahead Occasionally I Saw Brief Glimpses of Beauty,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0262240/,movie,8.4,288,2000,"Documentary, Biography",709,2000-11-04,Jonas Mekas

In retrospect, every time I stop to think about the circumstances of his life, the complexity of his predicament - how my father chose to solve his own equation - I sit in total awe at the sheer amount of energy it took for him to make it through each and every day.""

""And finally, sharing the joys and sorrows of helping my father struggle to make sense of his life's equation has made us as close as a brother and sister can ever hope to be, and enabled us to understand the transcendent source of unconditional devotion and loyalty, which is, of course, love.

""I am one of the searchers. There are, I believe, millions of us. We are not unhappy, but neither are we really content. We continue to explore life, hoping to uncover it's ultimate secret. We continue to explore ourselves, hoping to understand. We like to walk along the beach, we are drawn by the ocean, taken by it's power, it's unceasing motion, it's mystery and unspeakable beauty. We like forests and mountains, deserts and hidden rivers, and the lonely cities as well. Our sadness is as much a part of our lives as is our laughter. To share our sadness with one we love is perhaps as great a joy as we can know - unless it be to share our laughter.
We searchers are ambitious only for life itself, for everything beautiful it can provide. Most of all we love and want to be loved. We want to live in a relationship that will not impede our wandering, nor prevent our search, nor lock us in prison walls; that will take us for what little we have to give. We do not want to prove ourselves to another or compete for love. 
For wanderers, dreamers, and lovers, for lonely men and women who dare to ask of life everything good and beautiful. It is for those who are too gentle to live among wolves.""",Living with Wolves,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0473506/,tvMovie,8.7,95,2005,Documentary,300,2005-05-08,

Background:

""Women and girls are the most impoverished, discriminated-against group in the world. Consider the following:

*Of the world's 1 billion poorest people, 60 percent are women and girls.
*Women work two-thirds of the world's working hours, yet earn only 10 percent of the income.
*Women produce half the world's food, yet own only 1 percent of it's land.
*Women make up two-thirds of the estimated 776 million adults worldwide who cannot read or write; and girls make up 55 percent of the 75 million children not attending school.""

Margaret Mead quote: ""It has been a woman's task throughout history to go on believing in life where there was almost no hope.""

""In most societies, women face discrimination, exploitation and exclusion that limit their access to resources and assets. This disempowerment is a universal factor in extreme poverty. Rather than working with women as victims of poverty, more and more non-governmental organizations are working to empower marginalized women to challenge and change the context in which they live.""

""Tom Cappello quote: ""Film is the best way to get people emotionally connected to a cause...to get a discussion started.""

The Women:
 
""Hanh is an HIV-positive widow in Vietnam. Nada, a survivor of the Bosnian war. And Jacqueline works the slums of Bamako, Mali. 'A Powerful Noise' takes you inside the lives of these women to witness their daily challenges and significant victories over poverty and oppression.""

With 'Warrendale', for example, I learned that you could work with kids and help, particularly if they were young and had the flexibility to break through. I think people can work through problems and solve them. Emotional problems particularly. If they want to. But our tenacity is really daunting to overcome. We hold on to our neuroses with great tenacity because they are part of our very identity. The most terrifying thing of all for most people is to lose their identity. It's the hardest, most painful aspect of schizophrenia.""

""The art of Maynard Dixon is about the land. The color, temperature, intensity, and vastness of the desert were his subjects; the rhythms and forces of nature were his themes. To experience Dixon's work over time and in quantity is to refresh our own senses and to remember our own fundamental connection with earth and sky. We might call him a poet and a politician in addition to painter, such is Dixon's power to enable us to feel both the energy and the elegance of our own geography and by extension, to reflect upon the importance of the earth to virtually everything we do.""",Maynard Dixon: Art and Spirit,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1185430/,movie,8.1,66,2007,Documentary,17,2007-05-31,Jayne McKay

Fear of imprisonment, fear of torture, fear of death, fear of losing friends, family, property or means of livelihood, fear of poverty, fear of isolation, fear of failure. A most insidious form of fear is that which masquerades as common sense or even wisdom, condemning as foolish, reckless, insignificant or futile the small, daily acts of courage which help to preserve man's self-respect and inherent human dignity. It is not easy for a people conditioned by fear under the iron rule of the principle that might is right to free themselves from the enervating miasma of fear. Yet even under the most crushing state machinery courage rises up again and again, for fear is not the natural state of civilized people.""",Familiar Voices,https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1286144/,movie,6.9,67,2008,Documentary,10,2008-06-09,Danny Mendoza
